# fool_named
we don't like it at all.

This application is wrote for teachers who need to call the roll in a special way.
The effect what I want is that When you click the button "开始", The list in textarea start to roll, and then you click the button "抽取", the list stop rolling, and the last name is the fool.
But there are something wrong with the "Thread t1" and "Thread t2", I need t2 to stop t1, but don't know how. I have tried several ways just like "use boolean variate" and "use t1.stop() in t2" , but failed.
Now I'm trying all the time, and also need you to help me.
